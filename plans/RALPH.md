# Ralph Loop — wallrus build contract

This file is the **single prompt** the Ralph Loop plugin re-feeds every
iteration. The loop runs in the main session (Opus, the **reviewer**)
and delegates the heavy lifting to a Sonnet subagent (the **builder**,
`wallrus-builder`) per slice. Opus reviews the builder's diff,
re-runs gates, commits, pushes, and lets the Stop hook re-fire the
loop until the completion promise is emitted.

Plugin: <https://claude.com/plugins/ralph-loop>.

## Roles

| Role         | Model  | Job                                                                                                                               |
| ------------ | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Reviewer** | Opus   | Runs the loop. Spawns one `wallrus-builder` per slice. Reviews diffs. Re-runs verification gates. Commits + pushes. Marks `done`. |
| **Builder**  | Sonnet | Subagent (`.claude/agents/wallrus-builder.md`). Reads the slice, edits files, runs tests. Does NOT commit/push/edit plan status.  |

Why split: per-slice cost drops ~70-80% vs pure Opus while preserving a
review layer. The builder definition pins `model: sonnet` and forbids git
write operations.

**Important**: Start the ralph loop from an Opus session. The loop fires
the Stop hook on the _main_ session — whoever's driving the main session
is the reviewer. If you `/model sonnet` and then `/ralph-loop`, you lose
the review layer.

## Pre-flight (read before the first /ralph-loop run)

The `wallrus-builder` subagent is defined in
`.claude/agents/wallrus-builder.md`. Claude Code's agent registry
**scans this directory only at session start**. If the file was added
or edited during the current session, the registry does NOT see it —
`Agent({ subagent_type: "wallrus-builder" })` will fail with
`agent type not found`.

**Before triggering `/ralph-loop` for the first time** (or after any
edit to `.claude/agents/wallrus-builder.md`):

1. Exit Claude Code (`Ctrl+C` twice or `/exit`).
2. Re-open Claude Code from the same project directory.
3. Confirm registration: `/agents` should list `wallrus-builder`.
4. Then run the trigger command.

Skipping the restart wastes iterations and burns Opus tokens — the
reviewer cannot spawn the builder and the loop spins on the same
blocker until you `/cancel-ralph`. (See also the fallback in the Hard
rules section.)

## Trigger commands

The recommended way is to point at this file so the loop instructions stay
in version control rather than scrolled-back chat history.

### One-line trigger (recommended)

```bash
/ralph-loop "Follow plans/RALPH.md verbatim. You are the REVIEWER (Opus). Each iteration: identify the next pending slice in plans/<NNN>-<slug>/, spawn the wallrus-builder subagent to implement it, review the resulting diff + re-run verification gates, then commit + push. Output <promise>WALLRUS-MVP-COMPLETE</promise> only when every slice in plans/README.md index is done." --completion-promise "WALLRUS-MVP-COMPLETE" --max-iterations 80
```

### Embed-the-contract trigger (alternative, more self-contained)

```bash
/ralph-loop "$(cat plans/RALPH.md)" --completion-promise "WALLRUS-MVP-COMPLETE" --max-iterations 80
```

### Single-slice trigger (useful for debugging)

```bash
/ralph-loop "Follow plans/RALPH.md but stop after slice 003-auth lands. Output <promise>SLICE-DONE</promise> when its TASKS.md is fully checked and the commit is pushed." --completion-promise "SLICE-DONE" --max-iterations 12
```

### Cancel

```bash
/cancel-ralph
```

## What the loop must do each iteration

(All steps are performed by the **reviewer** — Opus, the main session —
unless tagged `[builder]`.)

1. **Sanity check**: run `git status`, `git log --oneline -5`, `ls plans/`.
   Confirm clean tree and `origin/main` parity.
2. **Pick the slice**: read `plans/README.md`. Find the lowest-numbered
   slice whose status is `not-started` or `in-progress`. That is **the
   slice**. If `Status: blocked`, do not unblock — emit no completion
   promise, let `--max-iterations` clamp.
3. **Read the slice index**: open `plans/<NNN>-<slug>/IMPLEMENTATION.md`.
   Confirm its `Decisions` haven't changed since last iteration (if you
   ran an iteration that ended `in-progress`).
4. **Spawn the builder** `[builder]` via the Task tool:
   - `subagent_type: "wallrus-builder"`
   - `description`: `"Implement slice <NNN>-<slug>"`
   - `prompt`: a self-contained brief that:
     - Names the slice path: `plans/<NNN>-<slug>/`.
     - Tells the builder to read `IMPLEMENTATION.md` + `TASKS.md` +
       `.builder-notes.md` (if present) end-to-end.
     - **Names the scope crisply** — which "Resume here" steps the
       builder should attempt this invocation. Default = "all
       unfinished steps". For slices with ≥6 Resume steps OR ≥4
       service operations OR ≥5 new files, **split the slice across
       2-3 builder invocations** (e.g. "steps 1-3 this invocation;
       reviewer will spawn you again for 4-6"). Smaller invocations
       = lower compaction risk = less halu.
     - Reminds the builder of the hard prohibitions (no commit, no push,
       no plan-status edits).
     - Asks for the structured report format described in
       `.claude/agents/wallrus-builder.md`.

### Recommended slice → invocation split (rule of thumb)

5. **Review the builder's report + diff** (also: halu detection):
   - `git status` and `git diff --stat HEAD` — ground truth.
   - **Halu check**: for every file the builder claimed to edit, confirm
     it appears in `git diff --stat`. If it doesn't, the builder
     hallucinated the edit — re-spawn with explicit correction citing
     the missing change.
   - Spot-check the most-touched files via Read. Confirm the actual code
     matches what was promised (right symbols, right imports, no
     placeholder TODOs). **Read-only** — never `Edit`/`Write` source.
   - Re-run the slice's "Verification gates" yourself
     (`bun run check`, `bun test`, `bunx eslint .`, `bunx prettier --check .`,
     slice-specific smoke). All read-only commands. Do not trust the
     builder's claim alone.
   - If gates fail: **always** spawn a fresh `wallrus-builder` in
     FIX-MODE with the exact gate output pasted in the prompt. The
     reviewer NEVER edits source — not even typos, not even a single
     `bunx prettier --write` pass. See §Fix-mode invocation below.
   - If multiple invocations are needed (per the split table), repeat
     step 4 with a new prompt: "steps 1-3 done per TASKS.md; do steps
     4-6 now." The builder reads TASKS.md state + .builder-notes.md and
     continues without re-doing work.
6. **Commit** using the slice's "Done definition" message
   (Conventional Commits, slice slug in the scope, Claude co-author
   trailer). Single closing commit per slice — squash interim builder
   output if needed via `git add` granularity.
7. **Push**: `git push`. On reject, `git pull --rebase` once and retry.
   If still failing, set the slice `Status: in-progress`, push the
   bookkeeping, exit **without** the completion promise.
8. **Mark done**: edit the slice's IMPLEMENTATION.md (`Status: done`) and
   the row in `plans/README.md` index.
9. **Bookkeeping commit + push**: `chore(plans): mark <NNN>-<slug> done`.
10. **If every slice in the index is `done`**: output the literal text
    `<promise>WALLRUS-MVP-COMPLETE</promise>` and stop.

## Hard rules (reviewer)

- **Reviewer NEVER touches code.** The rule is by file _kind_, not by
  directory.
  - **Allowed reviewer writes** (any of these is fine):
    - Any `.md` file anywhere in the repo — including
      `plans/<NNN>-*/IMPLEMENTATION.md`, `plans/<NNN>-*/TASKS.md`,
      `plans/<NNN>-*/.builder-notes.md`, `plans/README.md`,
      `plans/RALPH.md`, `engineering/SCOPE.md`,
      `engineering/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/**/*.md`, `README.md`,
      `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/rules/*.md`,
      `.claude/agents/*.md`. Reviewer can update narrative,
      decisions, status, notes, hand-off records, and rule
      documents freely.
    - Git commit messages (via `git commit -m`).
  - **Forbidden reviewer writes** (always delegate to a fresh
    `wallrus-builder` invocation):
    - Any source-code extension: `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.mjs`,
      `.cjs`, `.svelte`, `.css`, `.html`, `.sql`, `.json` (when it's
      a config or schema snapshot, e.g. `package.json`, `bun.lock`,
      `tsconfig*.json`, `drizzle/**/*.json`).
    - Config files: `lefthook.yml`, `eslint.config.*`,
      `.prettierrc*`, `svelte.config.js`, `vite.config.*`,
      `tailwind.config.*`, `commitlint.config.*`, `bunfig.toml`,
      `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `playwright.config.*`,
      any workflow under `.github/`.
    - Generated migrations under `drizzle/migrations/` (even
      though `.sql` would be caught above — restating for clarity).
  - Even trivial code regressions — a typo, a missing semicolon, a
    `bunx prettier --write` pass on a `.ts` file, a one-character
    test fix — go to a fresh `wallrus-builder` invocation.
  - **Reason**: Opus implementer time burns the user's quota; Sonnet
    builder cost is ~5× cheaper per token and the user has
    explicitly forbidden Opus implementations of code. Markdown,
    plan bookkeeping, and rule docs are cheap enough that the
    reviewer handling them directly is the right trade.
- **Fix-mode is also delegated.** If verification gates fail, do NOT
  fix locally. Spawn another `wallrus-builder` with a FIX-MODE prompt
  (see §Fix-mode invocation). The reviewer's only responsibility on
  failure is to read the failure output, choose the right prompt,
  re-spawn, and re-verify when the builder reports back.
- **Never edit a slice already marked `done`.** Done = historical record.
  New work = new slice (`NNN+1`).
- **One slice per iteration ceiling.** If the builder can't finish a
  slice in one invocation (or two splits), commit the builder's progress
  (preserving `- [~]` markers in TASKS.md), push, mark
  `Status: in-progress`, exit. Next iteration resumes.
- **Never invent scope.** If the builder reports ambiguity, consult the
  slice's `Decisions` first, then `engineering/SCOPE.md`. Do not add
  features not listed.
- **Never bypass `lefthook`.** No `--no-verify`. If a hook fails, fix the
  cause; do not skip.
- **Stop if blocked.** If the same Verification gate fails 3 iterations in
  a row on the same line of code, set `Status: blocked` in the slice's
  IMPLEMENTATION.md with a one-paragraph reason, push, and exit
  **without** emitting the completion promise. A human will unblock and
  re-trigger.
- **Push after every commit.** The loop assumes work is durable on
  `origin` before the next iteration starts.
- **Trust but verify the builder.** Always re-run gates locally — the
  builder's report describes intent, the gate output describes truth.
- **Builder unavailable → halt loop, do NOT improvise.** If
  `Agent({ subagent_type: "wallrus-builder" })` returns
  `agent type not found`, the registry didn't pick up
  `.claude/agents/wallrus-builder.md` (typically: agent file added or
  edited mid-session — see §Pre-flight). Do NOT fall back to
  `general-purpose` + `model: sonnet` to "keep the loop moving" — that
  bypasses the agent's hard prohibitions (no git writes, no plan
  status edits) and a misbehaving fallback can corrupt plan state. Do
  NOT implement the slice yourself (reviewer-never-touches-code stands).
  Action:
  1. State the blocker plainly in the iteration output.
  2. Do NOT emit the completion promise (it would be false).
  3. Do NOT commit any bookkeeping.
  4. Ask the user to `/cancel-ralph`, restart Claude Code, then
     re-trigger the loop. The tree stays at the last good commit.

## Hard rules (builder — enforced by `.claude/agents/wallrus-builder.md`)

- No `git commit`, no `git push`, no `--no-verify`.
- No edits to `plans/<NNN>-*/IMPLEMENTATION.md` `Status:` field.
- No edits to `plans/README.md` index status column.
- No new slices, no `plans/` restructure.
- No marking a TASKS line `[x]` unless the verification it implies passes.
- No silent design overrides — if Decisions conflict, STOP and report.

## Fix-mode invocation (when a verification gate fails)

Reviewer never fixes code. Every fix is a fresh `wallrus-builder`
invocation. Use this template:

```
You are resuming slice <NNN>-<slug> in FIX-MODE. The previous
invocation landed file changes but a verification gate failed.

GATE: <bun run check | bun test | bunx eslint . | bunx prettier --check . | <smoke command>>
EXACT OUTPUT:
<paste 10-40 relevant lines verbatim — TypeScript errors with
file:line, failing test name + assertion message, eslint rule +
file:line, prettier diff, smoke command stderr — whichever applies>

What to do:
1. Read TASKS.md and .builder-notes.md to ground-truth current state.
2. Run `git status` and `git diff --stat HEAD` so you see what the
   previous invocation actually wrote.
3. Diagnose the failure from the pasted output. Do NOT redo prior
   work — just fix the regression named by the gate.
4. Apply the smallest fix that makes the gate green.
5. Re-run the failing gate locally until it passes.
6. Re-run ALL gates (check, test, eslint, prettier, slice smoke) to
   confirm no new regression was introduced.
7. Report back with the standard report format from
   .claude/agents/wallrus-builder.md.

Hard rules unchanged: do NOT `git commit`. Do NOT `git push`. Do NOT
`--no-verify`. Do NOT edit IMPLEMENTATION.md Status or
plans/README.md.
```

**Fix-mode quota guard**: if the same gate fails 3 FIX-MODE
invocations in a row on the same slice, set the slice `Status: blocked`
with reason "fix-mode budget exceeded — likely a Decision conflict or
underspecified gate", push the bookkeeping, exit **without** the
completion promise. (Same exit semantics as the main blocked path.)

## Compaction defense — proactive HANDOFF protocol

Sonnet subagent contexts can auto-compact mid-invocation, which risks
hallucination as detail is summarized away. The defense is to **never let
compaction happen** — the builder self-monitors and emits a structured
HANDOFF report BEFORE the limit is hit, so the reviewer can spawn a
fresh builder with the HANDOFF embedded in the new prompt.

### Defenses layered (low → high reliability)

1. **Small invocations.** See the split table above. Smaller scope =
   fewer tokens burned = no handoff needed.
2. **TASKS.md is the checkpoint.** Each builder invocation reads it
   first. `- [~]` markers tell the next invocation exactly where to
   resume.
3. **`.builder-notes.md` per slice.** Design decisions / blockers /
   observations the next invocation needs but TASKS.md can't carry.
4. **Builder self-monitor** (`.claude/agents/wallrus-builder.md` §
   "Surviving compaction — proactive HANDOFF"). Triggers HANDOFF on:
   ≥25 tool calls, ≥15 file reads, system-reminder mentioning
   compaction, summarized-looking responses, or sub-area boundary.
5. **HANDOFF report format** is structured (yaml-ish block ending the
   message). Contains `stopped_at`, `last_action`, `in_flight`,
   `tasks_md_state`, `key_observations`, and
   `recommended_next_prompt` (paste-ready).
6. **Reviewer forwards HANDOFF** verbatim in the next builder spawn:

   ```
   The previous invocation handed off. Here is the HANDOFF block in full:

   <paste HANDOFF verbatim>

   Read .builder-notes.md and TASKS.md before doing anything. Run
   `git status` and `git diff --stat HEAD` to verify on-disk state
   matches the HANDOFF. Then resume.
   ```

7. **Reviewer halu check.** Always ground-truth the builder's claims via
   `git diff --stat HEAD` and Read before committing.

### Reviewer actions when builder returns a HANDOFF

1. Parse the HANDOFF block from the builder's final message.
2. Read `.builder-notes.md` + last few lines of `TASKS.md` to confirm
   the HANDOFF is consistent with disk.
3. `git status` and `git diff --stat HEAD` — verify `in_flight` files
   are actually modified, files claimed `[x]` actually have the
   expected changes.
4. If mismatch: trust disk, correct the next prompt accordingly.
5. Do **not** commit unless the slice is complete (HANDOFF means
   in-progress — leave the tree dirty, the next invocation continues).
   Exception: if the in-flight files are coherent and at a stable
   checkpoint, you MAY commit a `wip(<slug>): partial — handoff at
step N` to checkpoint to remote before the next invocation, then
   the next invocation amends or follows up. Default: don't commit on
   HANDOFF, just push the next invocation.
6. Spawn a fresh `wallrus-builder` with the new prompt as described in
   defense #6 above.
7. **Loop quota guard**: if a single slice triggers ≥ 4 HANDOFFs in a
   row, set the slice `Status: blocked` with reason "exceeded handoff
   budget — slice likely too large or under-specified", push the
   bookkeeping, exit **without** the completion promise. A human
   will split the slice into smaller follow-up slices.

## Commit policy

- One Conventional Commit per coherent chunk. Typical slice = 1 closing
  commit (`feat(<slug>): …`) plus an optional WIP commit if the slice
  splits across iterations.
- Scope = slice slug (e.g. `feat(auth): …`, `feat(ingest): …`).
- Co-author trailer:
  ```
  Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>
  ```
- The slice's "Done definition" defines the **final** commit message.

## Verification baseline (every slice)

These must pass before any commit:

- `bun run check` — svelte-check + tsc, zero errors.
- `bun test` — zero failures.
- `bunx eslint .` — zero **errors** (warnings on placeholder mixin
  scaffolds are acceptable until the relevant slice removes them).
- `bunx prettier --check .` — clean.
- `lefthook` pre-commit (gitleaks + format + lint + tsc + bun test) and
  commit-msg (commitlint) pass on real `git commit`.

Slice-specific smoke (curl, Playwright, manual run) is listed in the
slice's IMPLEMENTATION.md.

## Testing best practice (the builder enforces these per slice)

- **Unit tests** alongside the file under test (`foo.ts` → `foo.test.ts`),
  run by `bun test`.
- **Service mixins**: test via the service surface, not into the mixin.
  Mock DB with an in-memory `bun:sqlite` instance running the same
  migrations.
- **API routes**: import the `+server.ts` handler and call with a
  constructed `Request`. Assert response shape against the slice's Zod
  schema.
- **Sources**: fixture-based. Capture a representative response JSON
  under `src/lib/server/sources/__fixtures__/` and assert the async
  generator yields the expected `SourceItem`s.
- **Playwright e2e**: extend `tests/e2e/smoke.spec.ts` only when a slice
  changes a user-visible route.
- **No flakiness shortcuts.** No `test.skip`, no `--bail`, no time-based
  sleeps.

## File-touching budget

- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones. The directory
  layout is set in 001 — extend it, don't restructure it.
- A single iteration's diff should be **understandable in one read**.
  If a slice grows past ~600 changed lines, split it: commit what's
  green, mark `in-progress`, exit.

## When the loop is allowed to stop

Only two clean exits:

1. **Completion**: every slice in `plans/README.md` index is `done`.
   Output `<promise>WALLRUS-MVP-COMPLETE</promise>`.
2. **Blocked**: a slice is set `Status: blocked` and pushed. Do **not**
   emit the completion promise. The Stop hook will keep firing until
   `--max-iterations` is reached, which is the intended safety net.

Any other exit (give-up, "I think we're done", "this seems hard") is a
**violation** of the loop contract per `commands/ralph-loop.md` — emit
the completion promise **only when true**.

## Sanity checks before each iteration

Before doing anything, the reviewer runs (cheap, re-establishes ground
truth after possible compaction):

```bash
git status
git log --oneline -5
ls plans/
```

Then proceeds to "What the loop must do each iteration" step 2.
